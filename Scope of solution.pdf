1. Design and implement a solar tracking system using a microcontroller and light sensors.
2. System must rotate the panel (1 or 2-axis) using servo or DC motors based on sensor data.
3. Use simulated circuits and optionally a real prototype.
4. Improve the efficiency of energy generation compared to static panels.
5. Provide code, simulation, and documentation for submission.
