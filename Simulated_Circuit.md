Simulated Circuit â€“ TinkerCAD (Double Axis Solar Tracker)

This simulation demonstrates the working of a 2-axis solar panel tracker using:
- Arduino Uno
- 4 LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors)
- 2 Servo Motors
- Breadboard and resistors

The tracker adjusts both horizontally and vertically based on light intensity to maximize sunlight capture.

Logic Overview

- Two LDRs on the horizontal axis and two on the vertical axis detect sunlight.
- The Arduino reads the analog values and moves the respective servo motors.
- Servo 1 controls horizontal (azimuth) movement.
- Servo 2 controls vertical (elevation) tilt.
